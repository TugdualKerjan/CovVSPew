# CovVSPew
A streaming test
Using python and matplotlib to chart the difference between COVID-19 and PewDiePie subscribers

---
# Observations
1. Youtube API no longer displays exact amount of subscribers, thus I just use random(0, 6) - 2 make the subs progressivley increase with slight randomness
2. I could be using requests to get current sub count, rn it's based on 19 April 2020 stats
3. Overlaying images in matplotlib is a pain
4. Used OBS to stream video to youtube from main computer
